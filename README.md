# Predictive-Maintenance-for-Industrial-Machinery
Implementing Predictive Maintenance (PdM) using machine learning to forecast equipment failures, minimize downtime, and optimize maintenance in industrial settings. Leverage historical sensor data for proactive maintenance interventions, reducing costs and enhancing productivity.
Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict equipment failure in a manufacturing environment using machine learning techniques. By leveraging historical data on equipment operation and maintenance, the project seeks to develop predictive models that can identify potential failures before they occur, allowing for proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to equipment operation, environmental conditions, and maintenance history. These features include operating hours, environmental temperature and humidity, equipment age, power consumption, sensor readings, error codes, production volume, and more. The dataset also includes a binary target variable indicating whether maintenance was required due to equipment failure.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The dataset underwent preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): EDA was performed to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between variables, identify outliers, and understand patterns in the data.
Feature Engineering: Feature engineering techniques were applied to create new features, handle skewness, and select relevant features for modeling.
Modeling: Several machine learning algorithms were trained and evaluated for their predictive performance in identifying equipment failure. Techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning were used to optimize model performance.
Evaluation: Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score. Confusion matrices and ROC curves were also used to assess model performance.
Results
The project achieved promising results in predicting equipment failure, with the best-performing model Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of 52.3% and an ROC AUC score of 52.1%. The model demonstrated the ability to identify potential failures with high precision and recall, enabling proactive maintenance strategies.

Future Work
Future work for this project includes:

Incorporating additional data sources to improve model performance and robustness.
Exploring advanced modeling techniques such as ensemble methods and deep learning architectures.
Deploying the predictive model in a real-time monitoring system for proactive maintenance scheduling.
Continuous monitoring and updating of the model with new data to ensure its effectiveness over time.
